American Crossword Puzzle Generator, next attempt

requirements:
matrix that can be pre-populated with letters and # to mark black fields
dimensions, x,y. Probably square for the time being to allow mirroring vert./horiz.
dictionary with "WORD explanation" combinations


while x% of the board are spaces, go into the main loop

  read the matrix and start point
  if start point not given, determine a random start point, any free field will do
  call find_start_field and get x, y
  make a backup copy of the matrix
  find a random word from the dictionary, get the length
   loop through its letters from x to x+length
     check if loop value is within board size
     if not: fail
     check matrix[x][y] is free
     if yes: put letter
             check if surroundings exist and enter next recursion
     check matrix if #, then fail
  when word is done: return matrix

not enough spaces left: print and end

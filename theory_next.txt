American Crossword Puzzle Generator, next attempt

requirements:
matrix that can be pre-populated with letters and # to mark black fields
dimensions, x,y. Probably square for the time being to allow mirroring vert./horiz.
dictionary with "WORD explanation" combinations

read the matrix and start point

while x% of the board are spaces, do the main loop

  if start point outside boundaries, determine an inside start point, any free field will do
  call find_start_field and get x, y
  make a backup copy of the matrix
  find a random word from the dictionary, get the length
   loop through its letters from x to x+length
     check if loop value is within board size
     if not: fail
     check matrix[x][y] is free or same letter
     if yes: check if next field is outside or free or black block
          if yes:
             put letter
             check if surroundings exist
             if yes: mirror matrix and start main loop with matrix, x, y
             mirror matrix (back)
     if yes: then fail
    if fail, then return backup matrix
  when word is done: set x, y to outside and return matrix

not enough spaces left: end, analyze board and create list



missing: analyze board, find strings and explanations from dictionary, count black blocks and print

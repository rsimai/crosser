American Crossword

create basic matrix, the master, probably pre-populated
set the x/y boundaries (same for the time being)
set the wordfile to be used


main_recurse loop, needs matrix, y, x
  read the matrix from argument
  mirrored = no
  if not y, x: find start location. If no location available: we're done!
  find direction, smaller number may get higher prob., eventually mirror the matrix, swap mirror flag!
  search for start point, go left until hit black block or boundary, set y, x
  read word list, find random word
  make backup copy of matrix
  loop through, letter by letter
    if space in matrix, put the letter
    if non matching letter -> return, backup matrix, y, x!
    if hit black block or boundary -> return, backup matrix, y, x!
    check left/right, if next to an existing letter
      yes: mirror the matrix, and the limits, swap mirror flag
        and: call recurse_loop with matrix and new x, y start location
    else: word was done without conflicts, return the matrix and -1 for x/y


we're done: print it and exit
